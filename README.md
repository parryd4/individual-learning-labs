# Individual Learning Labs

The purpose of this application is for users to improve the way they organize and manage information they get from the internet. Are your bookmarked web pages manageable? Do you often have dozens of tabs across multiple windows open with pages you plan on visiting later? How well is this actually working for you?

ILL's purpose is for users to save web pages or media and categorize it by topic or purpose in the form of "Labs". Each lab consists of Material (articles, videos, discussions, etc) containing a title, a url, and notes.

## Ideation to remove later
Step 1) User creates account, email confirmation?
Step 2) User creates first "Lab" (overall category, ex: Personal Finance. By default private, can be toggled any time, or maybe username can be private/toggled)
  lab belongs to user, has many "Materials" (articles, videos, own notes, discussion) (maybe a mini forum? or single discussion thread?)
Step 3) User creates first Material within Lab,
  Top of form appears, select type (radio buttons): "**Video**, Article, BlankNote, Discussion"
  After selected, text field appears below to enter URL, and text box below for notes(eventually formatable?)
User Submits/Saves/Creates the Material.
  Views: Goes to Show page for Material. Show page for User's Lab now has link to material.
  DB:

MVP: CRUD,
Create: string for youtube url. (can youtube link be scraped by nokogiri or something similar?)
text for notes. (this could be a mini TextEditor, or allow formatting like bold/lists, etc)
