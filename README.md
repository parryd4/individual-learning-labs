# Individual Learning Labs

The purpose of this application is for users to improve the way they organize and manage information they get from the internet. Are your bookmarked web pages manageable? Do you often have dozens of tabs across multiple windows open with pages you plan on visiting later? How well is this actually working for you?

ILL's purpose is for users to save web pages or media and categorize it by topic or purpose in the form of "Labs". Each lab consists of Material (articles, videos, discussions, etc) containing a title, a url, and notes.
